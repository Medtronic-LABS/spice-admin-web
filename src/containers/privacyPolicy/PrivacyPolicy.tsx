            This Privacy Statement tells you how we protect and use information that we gather through MEDTRONIC LABS
            SPICE Mobile Application (the “Application” or “App”). This Privacy Statement is intended for a global
            audience.
          </p>

            and for any reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except as written in any other disclaimers, policies, terms of use, or other notices in an Application, this
            Privacy Statement is a complete agreement between you and MEDTRONIC LABS with respect to your use of the
            Application. By using MEDTRONIC LABS SPICE Mobile Application (the “Application” or “App”), you agree to the
            terms of the most recent version of this Privacy Statement. You may be subject to additional terms that may
            apply when you access particular services or materials on certain areas in this Application, or by following
            a link from this Application.
          </p>
